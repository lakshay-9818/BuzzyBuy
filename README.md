# BuyBusy is a web application for the customers of an e-commerce business.

Developed an E-Commerce that enables individuals to browse available items, add or remove them from their shopping cart, and complete the purchasing process.

# Key Features
- Created and initialize a new firestore for the BusyBuy app and include it inside the project.

- Created a register page that allows new users to register into your app.

- Created a login page that allows existing users to login into your app.

- Created a home page to display a list of products. The home page should include a feature to search products by name.

- Created a cart page to display the products that the user has added to the cart.

- Created a product card component that displays the image, title, price, and a button to add or remove that specific product from the cart. If the product is already in the cart, its quantity should be increased.

- The product card should only render the increase and decrease buttons if the product is on the cart page.

- Created an orders page to display the products the user has purchased and the order date.

- Created a sidebar to filter the products based on product price and categories on the HomePage. The search and filter should be applied to the products simultaneously.

- Added conditional rendering to show the absence of data and loading state using the react-spinners library.

- Show toast messages for async actions and error conditions using the react-toastify library.
